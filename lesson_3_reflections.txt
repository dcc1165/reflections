When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When sharing repos with other collabortors or computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It avoids conflicts if multiple collaborators are making changes to the 
    same branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another.

    Cloning and forking are similar except forking contains a reference back
    to the original repo where the fork was made.

    A branch is an "offshoot" of a single repository.
